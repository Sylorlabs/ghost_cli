# Commands

### `ghost chat`
Conversational interface to task operator.
Usage: `ghost chat --message="explain this project" --reasoning=balanced`

### `ghost ask`
Short one-shot question. Proxies to chat internals using a limited session.
Usage: `ghost ask "what does this config do?"`

### `ghost fix`
User asks Ghost to propose or perform a fix.
Usage: `ghost fix "make the failing runtime test pass" --reasoning=deep`

### `ghost verify`
Ask engine to verify current task/workspace state.
Usage: `ghost verify --reasoning=deep`
Usage: `ghost verify --context-artifact=src/main.zig --reasoning=max`

### `ghost packs`
Manage knowledge packs via `ghost_knowledge_pack`.

#### `ghost packs list`
List all available and mounted knowledge packs.
Usage: `ghost packs list`

#### `ghost packs inspect <pack-id>`
Show detailed information about a specific pack.
Usage: `ghost packs inspect zig_runtime_sync`
Usage: `ghost packs inspect zig_runtime_sync --version=1.0.0`

#### `ghost packs mount <pack-id>`
Mount a knowledge pack into the current session.
Usage: `ghost packs mount zig_runtime_sync`

#### `ghost packs unmount <pack-id>`
Unmount a knowledge pack.
Usage: `ghost packs unmount zig_runtime_sync`

### `ghost tui`
Interactive Ghost Console TUI. Provides a live cockpit view for interacting with the engine.

Usage: `ghost tui [--reasoning=quick|balanced|deep|max] [--context-artifact=<path>]`

History output uses the same renderer as terminal chat/ask output, including correction, negative-knowledge, and epistemic sections when the engine reports them. The status bar includes compact counters for corrections, applied/proposed negative knowledge, verifier requirements, suppressions, and routing warnings.

#### Keybindings
- `Ctrl+C`: Quit
- `Ctrl+R`: Cycle reasoning level (quick → balanced → deep → max)
- `Ctrl+D`: Toggle debug mode
- `Ctrl+L`: Clear history area
- `Esc`: Quit
- `q`: Quit (only when input is empty)

#### Slash Commands
- `/quit`: Exit TUI
- `/help`: Show help text
- `/status`: Show session turn count and settings
- `/reasoning <level>`: Change reasoning level
- `/context <path>`: Set context artifact path

### `ghost learn`
Feedback/distillation surface for managing knowledge growth.

#### `ghost learn candidates`
List potential knowledge distillation candidates.
Usage: `ghost learn candidates --project-shard=my-project`

#### `ghost learn show <candidate-id>`
Show detailed metrics and provenance for a specific candidate.
Usage: `ghost learn show my_candidate --project-shard=my-project`

#### `ghost learn export <candidate-id>`
Export a reviewed candidate to a persistent knowledge pack.
Usage: `ghost learn export my_candidate --project-shard=my-project --pack-id=my_pack --version=1.0.0 --approve`

### `ghost status`
Show environment status and binary availability.
Usage: `ghost status`

### `ghost debug`
Advanced user diagnostic tool. Bypasses JSON serialization or runs raw engine paths.
Usage: `ghost debug raw <engine-binary> [args...]`
Example: `ghost debug raw ghost_knowledge_pack list`

For rendered commands such as `ghost ask --debug`, debug output reports whether correction, negative-knowledge, and epistemic fields were detected without dumping large arrays.
